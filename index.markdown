### Our Story: Authentic & Woman-Owned
My name is April, and when I was growing up my great grandmother used to make clothes for me and my siblings. No matter how "unique" the clothes looked, you wore them to make her happy.

I've always had trouble finding cute trendy and affordable clothes that made me feel good. I struggled with every plus size brand in some way and so fast forward to 2019 I decided to buy a sewing machine and learn to make my own. Inspired by my great grandmother's example.

Now I want to share my passion and cute clothes that are made with love to fit plus size beauties. I do different ranges of sizes, custom vinyl appliques, and accessories.

Follow my shop on Etsy or check me out on social media for to see my latest creations. 

Have any questions or want to doa custom order? I'd love to hear from you: [april@lackingapollo.com](mailto:april@lackingapollo.com).

With love & fashion!
#### April T.
