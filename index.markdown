### Our Story: Authentic & Woman-Owned
My name is April. When I was growing up my great grandmother use to sew me and my two siblings matching outfits, back then I was still plus size and she always had something to say 🙄, but you wore the clothes no matter what to make her happy.

Moving forward I always had trouble finding cute trendy and affordable clothes that made me feel good. I struggled with every plus size brand in some way and so fast forward to 2019 I decided to buy a sewing machine and make my own. Admittedly it was to sew masks but you know, I loved doing that so it went further. 

Now I want to share my passion and cute clothes that are made with love to fit plus size beauties. I do different ranges of sizes, custom vinyl appliques, and accessories. Follow us on Facebook or Instagram to see new items and get exclusive access to deals, unique items & promotions.

Have any questions? I'd love to hear from you: [april@lackingapollo.com](mailto:april@lackingapollo.com).

With love & fashion!
